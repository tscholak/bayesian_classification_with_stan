# Bayesian Learning of Classifiers with Stan

These are the sources for the talk I gave at the [Toronto Probabilistic Programming Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Toronto-Probabilistic-Programming-Meetup/events/229134538/). They are released under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license, see below.

Read [here](https://github.com/tscholak/presentation_template) about how you can build and view the slides.

For the impatient, I also converted the slides to pdf. Head [here](https://github.com/suhailshergill/ProPL-meetup/tree/master/04_02__Bayesian_Learning_of_Classifiers_with_Stan__Torsten_Scholak) and download `talk.pdf`. At the same location, you will also find a jupyter notebook, `stan_demo.ipynb`, containing a little demo of Bayesian logistic regression with `pystan`.
